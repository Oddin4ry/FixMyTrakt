# FixMyTrakt
The language is C++ in Linux/Ubuntu.

My trakt account has a lot of things such as ratings, watched shows/movies etc. Firstly it is going to prune them so I can keep my data to a minimum.

Secondly, it is going to help create lists based on searches and existing lists. e.g. I have show lists on 30, 40, 60 and "Relax". I want to ensure shows are on the right lists. e.g. If a 60 minute show is on a 30 minute list then move it.

Thirdly, when shows are watched and it has ended then it will remove all watch instances and store locally that it was watched. It will also remove it from any lists. This will keep the first goal of keeping the data to a minimum at trakt.tv. 

Lastly, to help find new shows there will be a look up of shows not watched (locally or on trakt) and it will help you pick out shows based on the lists.

There may be opportunity for movies in the future, this is well in the future.
